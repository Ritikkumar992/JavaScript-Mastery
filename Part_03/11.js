//Basic Theory

//AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML:
// it is a set of 'web development ' technique.
//using many web technologies on the client-side.
//to create asynchronous web application.

//HTTP request: it helps to build communication between client and server.

//With AJAX: web application can send and retrive
// data from a server asynchronously(in the background)
// without the inteferance of display and 
// behavious of the existing page.

// We don't use data in XML format anymore.
// we use JSON now. ----> JavaScript Object Notation.

//We have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server.
// 1) xmlHTTPrequest (old way of doing)
// 2) fetch API (new way of doing)
// 3) axios (this is third party library)
